Power BI dashboard delivering revenue, cost, and variance insights for executive decision-making.

Executive FP&A Dashboard | Revenue, Cost & Profit Variance Analysis
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze financial performance, identify key variance drivers, and communicate insights in an executive-ready format using Power BI.
The dashboard is designed from the perspective of a Finance Analyst / FP&A Business Partner, focusing on why performance deviated from budget — not just what happened.

 **Business Objective**
 
The goal of this analysis was to:
* Evaluate Actual vs Budget performance
* Identify revenue and cost variance drivers
* Understand performance by region and department
* Translate financial data into clear executive insights
The dashboard answers core management questions such as:
* Where are we underperforming?
* Which regions and departments are driving losses?
* Are variances driven by volume, efficiency, or cost structure?
* Which cost drivers require immediate attention?

**Key KPIs Tracked**

* Total Revenue	- Actual revenue generated
* Budgeted Revenue	- Planned revenue target
* Revenue Variance	- Actual vs Budget
* Profit Variance -	Overall profitability gap
* Cost Variance	- Unfavourable vs favourable cost movements
*Volume Variance -	Impact of activity levels
*Efficiency Variance -	Operational efficiency impact

**Dashboard Overview**

1. Executive KPI Summary
High-level snapshot of:
* Total Revenue vs Budget
* Revenue Variance
* Profit Variance
  
**Insight**:
Overall revenue underperformed budget, resulting in a significant profit shortfall.

2️. **Revenue Variance by Month**

Analyzes performance trends over time.

**Key Insight**:
All months underperformed against budget, with October showing the largest unfavourable variance, indicating systemic issues rather than a one-off anomaly.

3️. **Revenue Variance by Region**

Compares regional performance.

**Key Insight**:
All regions missed budget targets, with Central Region recording the worst revenue variance, making it the primary contributor to overall underperformance.

4️. **Revenue Variance by Department**

Evaluates departmental contribution to revenue shortfalls.

**Key Insight**:
Every department recorded losses, with Operations experiencing the most severe underperformance, highlighting operational execution risks.

5️. **Cost Variance Drivers by Region**

Breaks down cost variance into:
*Labour
*Maintenance
*Power
*Other costs

**Key Insight**:
Labour costs account for over 50% of unfavourable cost variance across all regions, making it the dominant cost pressure and a key focus area for management action.

6️. Variance Drivers: Volume vs Efficiency
Separates performance drivers into:
*Activity levels (volume)
*Operational efficiency

**Key Insight**:
Efficiency variance outweighed volume variance, suggesting that performance issues are driven more by cost control and execution than by demand levels.

**Analytical Approach**

This project follows a structured FP&A methodology:
* Actual vs Budget comparison
* Variance decomposition (Revenue, Cost, Profit)
* Driver analysis (Volume, Efficiency, Cost drivers)
* Dimensional analysis (Region & Department)
* Executive storytelling with clear, actionable insights

**Tools & Skills Used**

**Power BI**
* DAX measures
* Variance calculations
* Interactive visuals
* Cross-filtering and drill-down

**Financial Analysis**
* Budget vs Actual analysis
* Cost driver decomposition
* FP&A storytelling

**Data Modeling & Visualization**
* KPI cards
* Clustered & stacked bar charts
* Executive dashboard design
